            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>One of the things I love to do in my free time is playing video games. My favourite one is Counter-Strike. I really enjoy playing video games because of the joy that it gives me and the fact that the most of my friends live away from me and it's the best way to spend some time together if we cant meet face to face. I also really like to watch e-sport matches where I can learn many new things from the best players in the world.</p>

            <h2>Sport</h2>
            <p>I love playing volleyball and I do it every other Tuesday. Maybe I am not that good at it but I really enjoy it and I think everyone needs some exercise. I also really like football but I don't play it that much. Mostly I am watching matches online, usually I watch FC Barcelona matches because that's my favourite club.</p>

            <h2>IT</h2>
            <p>One of my interest is IT. I am learning to become IT technician, so I think it's good that I really like it. Mostly I like to watch or do thing related to assembling computers but I also really like programming and I think I am good at it for a beginner.</p>
